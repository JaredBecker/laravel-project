=================
- When creating tables you don't have to do it manually. You can do it by using php artisan make:migration table_name. This creates a migration file where you can define the table names
- To run your migration files you can run php artisan migrate. This will look at all migration files and create your tables for you.
- Seeders allow us to create dummy data. They do this by using factories which use a library called faker to generate random data for us for testing.
- To run seeders you type php artisan php:seed in the cmd
- To clear out data you can just run php artisan migration:refresh which clears out all your tables
- If you want to clear data and reseed it you can run php artisan migration:refresh --seed
- You can create custom factories with php artisan make:factory SomeNameFactory

|   TEMPLATES   |
=================
- @yield('some_name') allows us to specify a location within a template where we should load dynamic content. This allows us to keep things like headers, footers and menus constant without having to define it in each view.
- In the files that will be components of a page we use @extends('template_name') and then wrap all the content with @section('name_inside_@yield')
